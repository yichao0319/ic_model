sim_ic_model.m
  The first version of simulation, which is mainly done by David.

sim_ic_model_v2.m
  The modified version which is the one to generate sim results (2015.12.18).

sim_ic_model_v2_poisson.m
  Because the Poisson Model is slightly different from MC model, I copy sim_ic_model_v2.m and make an independant version for Poisson Model.

plot_sim_v2_results.m
  Plot the simulation results from sim_ic_model_v2.m and sim_ic_model_v2_poisson.m
