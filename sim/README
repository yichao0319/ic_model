sim_ic_model.m
  The first version of simulation, which is mainly done by David.

sim_ic_model_v2.m
  The modified version which is the one to generate sim results (2015.12.18).

sim_ic_model_v2_poisson.m
  Because the Poisson Model is slightly different from MC model, I copy sim_ic_model_v2.m and make an independant version for Poisson Model.

plot_sim_v2_results.m
  Plot the simulation results from sim_ic_model_v2.m and sim_ic_model_v2_poisson.m


--------------------
Internal Link

sim_ic_model_internal_link.m
sim_ic_model_internal_link_poisson.m
    The two are used to simulate IC model with internal links. This version use random or IC model probability to select an existing node to build link. But, according to David, this process does not fit his model.

sim_ic_model_internal_link_v2.m
    Use the probability given by David to build interal links.
